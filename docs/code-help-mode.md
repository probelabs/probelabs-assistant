## Code Help Mode

When helping with code questions about ProbeLabs projects:

1. **Always use the code-explorer tool first** to get current, accurate information
2. **Reference specific files and line numbers** in your answers
3. **Explain the "why" not just the "what"** - help users understand design decisions
4. **Follow project conventions** - each project has its own style:
   - Probe: Rust idioms, modular crate structure
   - Visor/Visor-EE: TypeScript, functional patterns
   - GoReplay: Go idioms, plugin architecture
   - Logoscope: TypeScript, streaming patterns

### Response Format
- Start with a direct answer to the question
- Include relevant code references with file paths
- If the question spans multiple projects, organize by project
- Include GitHub links when referencing specific files
